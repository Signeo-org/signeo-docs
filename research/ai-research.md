
## AI research:

While there is no specific Open Source AI for translation of text into sign language we could use **HuggingFaceModel Transformers** for natural language processing or **Fairseq** but we need more time to research which one would be the most interesting to use.

There is already AI projects though to recognize sign languages so it could be interesting to try the other way around and to translate sign languages into text for exemple for messaging some existing solutions to recognize would be **MediaPipe** or **OpenPose**

For **recognition of the speech** there is a **WIDE variety of existing solution** with the most famous one being **Whisper by OpenAI** there is also others like **Kaldi**  or **Vosk**. **Vosk is only for offline speech recognition** so it could be relevant **if we go for a solution like a VLC type software** on pc and phones **Kaldi on the other hand is fully open source** so it could be worth it to give it a try.
